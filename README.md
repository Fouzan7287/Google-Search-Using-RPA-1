# Google-Search-Using-RPA
In today's digital age, accessing information quickly and efficiently is crucial. Google, the world's leading search engine, provides vast amounts of data with just a few clicks. However, the sheer volume of search results can overwhelm users, leading to increased time consumption and higher workloads when trying to sift through the information. This becomes particularly challenging for researchers, students, and professionals who rely on Google searches for data collection and decision-making.

To address this issue, our project proposes a solution that leverages Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to streamline and simplify the process of extracting Google search results. By integrating RPA technology, we aim to automate the collection of relevant search data and transform it into a structured Excel sheet format. This will not only reduce the time required to manually browse and filter through search results but also minimize the workload, allowing users to focus on analysis and decision-making.

Through the use of RPA, our system will be able to automatically perform repetitive tasks, such as retrieving search results, filtering key data, and exporting it to Excel in an organized, easy-to-read manner. This approach ensures efficiency, accuracy, and user-friendliness, offering a significant improvement in the way users interact with search engine data.
